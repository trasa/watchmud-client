# WatchMUD Client

A (super simple) client for the [WatchMud](http://github.com/trasa/watchmud) Project.

The WatchMUD server hosts a static website including a LOT of Javascript 
which worked as the original testing ground for the basic connectivity
and some simple functionality, but things are getting out of hand. Instead
this is a command line program that connects to WatchMUD server via WebSocket
and from there operates much like an old telnet client...
